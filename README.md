# dual-camera-system
Dual camera system on Raspberry Pi with real-time GUI , adjustable camera parameters, and synchronous image capture inTIFF format.
# Project Goals  
1. Development of gaphical user interface (GUI) that displays both camera streams simultaneously and in real time side by side .
2. Implementation of adjustable camera parameters for each camera:
- Exposure time
- Gain
- White balance
- Resolution
- Frame rate
- Storage location for captured images
3. Implementation of a synchronous image capture mechanism where both cameras are triggered together and images are saved in TIFF format including timestamps.
# Project Status
- GUI implemented using PyQt6
- Dual camera control implemented on Raspberry Pi
- Source code upload in progress
# Current Status 
- Real time dual camera streamig with adjustable parameters is implemented .
- Synchronous image capture in TIFF format is supported
- Further evaluation of camera synchronization accuracy is planned .
